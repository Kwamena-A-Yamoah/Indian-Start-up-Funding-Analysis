    "Team Namibia is trying to venture into the Indian start-up ecosystem. As the data expert of the team, we are to investigate the ecosystem and propose the best course of action.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Statement:\n",
    "Ideas, creativity, and execution are essential for a start-up to flourish. But are they enough? Investors provide start-ups and other entrepreneurial ventures with the capital---popularly known as \"funding\"---to think big, grow rich, and leave a lasting impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we are investigating the dynamics of startup funding in India over the period from 2018 to 2021. The aim is to understand the trends, sector preferences, investment stages, key investors, and funding Patterns. Additionally, if there have been significant differences in funding amounts across different years and sectors, it can guide the action plan to be taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "In this analysis we will provide insights into the startup funding landscape in India from 2018 to 2021 by: \n",
    "- Identifying trends and patterns in funding amounts over the years.\n",
    "- Determining which sectors received the most funding and how sector preferences changed over time.\n",
    "- Understanding the distribution of funding across different stages of startups (e.g., Seed, Series A).\n",
    "- Identifying key investors and their investment behaviors.\n",
    "- Analyzing the geographical distribution of funding within India.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analytical Questions\n",
    "1. What are the trends and patterns in funding amounts for startups in India between 2018 to 2021?\n",
    "   - Analyzing the annual and quarterly trends in funding can reveal patterns and growth trajectories. Look for peaks, dips, and any consistent growth patterns over these years.\n",
    "2. Which sectors received the most funding, and how did sector preferences change over time from 2018 to 2021?\n",
    "   - Identifying which industries or sectors received the most funding can show sectoral preferences and shifts. Understanding how this distribution has evolved over the years can highlight emerging trends and declining interests.\n",
    "3. How is the distribution of funding across different stages of startups (e.g., Seed, Series A)?\n",
    "   - Analyzing the funding amounts at different startup stages can provide insights into the investment appetite at various growth phases. It can also help in understanding the maturity and risk preference of investors.\n",
    "4. Who are the key investors in Indian startups, and what are their investment behaviors/patterns?\n",
    "   - Identifying the most active investors and analyzing their investment portfolios can shed light on key players in the ecosystem. Understanding their investment patterns can also reveal strategic preferences and alliances.\n",
    "5. What is the geographical distribution of startup funding within India, and how has this distribution changed over the years 2018 to 2021?\n",
    "   - Analyzing the geographical distribution of startup funding can show regional hotspots for entrepreneurship and investment. Observing how this has changed over the years can reveal shifts in regional focus and development."
